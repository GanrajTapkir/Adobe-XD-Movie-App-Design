A mobile app interface designed in Adobe XD, focused on movie browsing. The design consists of two screens.

1. Left Screen - Main Movie List:

Titled "Movies Now," this screen displays a list of "upcoming" movies categorized by genre and release year.

Thereâ€™s a dropdown menu for location selection (set to "Bangalore").

Search and settings icons are in the top-right corner.

Movies are represented as cards with images, titles, release years, and genres.

Featured movies include "Sonic," "Scoob!," "Boss Baby," "Croods," "Frozen," and "Minions." Each card has a distinct color background matching the movie theme.



2. Right Screen - Movie Detail View:

This screen provides details for the movie "Sonic" (2020, Fantasy).

A large image of Sonic appears at the top.

Below, there is a "Cast" section showing images of actors.

A placeholder "INFO" section contains a short description in Latin placeholder text (Lorem ipsum).

A prominent "NOTIFY ME" button is at the bottom for notifications about the movie.




The design uses a clean, colorful layout with distinct movie categories and an engaging user interface.
